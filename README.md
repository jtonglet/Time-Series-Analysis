Project realised for the KULeuven course [Advanced Time Series Analysis](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/D0M63BE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp133344) given by Professor Christophe Croux.

The dataset consists of four time series describing the number of active users, active sessions, new users and crashes of a real world mobile app. Data is gathered every hour for a period of one week. 


The repository contains the following files :

1.Time_series.pdf : A slide deck with detailed explanations of the analysis.
2.Time_series.R :  The R code.
3.dataset.csv : The full dataset, retrieved from  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wolfgangb33r/usercount).
